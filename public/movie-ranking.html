<h1>The Best Movies According to Crepin Sterve</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. It basically predicted the reality we're currently living in over 2 decades ago</p>
<h3>The Terminator</h3>
<p>Really cool sci-fi movie, which serves as a warning on the dangers of AI.</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>Great fantasy adventure. Really artistic.</p>
